Chefs-Shop is a website that I built as part of my training to become a Full Stack Web Developer with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). This project allowed me to showcase my skills in both HTML and CSS.

To do this and simplify culinary needs, I created a one-stop online shop for expert chefs where users are connected with expert chefs who are ready to meet all of their culinary needs.

## About the project

I created this responsive Chefs-Shop website to practice, develop, and demonstrate my HTML and CSS skills. Chefs-Shop is an invented online shop that offers users access to various internationally experienced ready-to-go chefs. I have chosen this theme as I feel the need for such a place to exist where one can click and access a chef who can prepare different kinds of meals, whether for a small or large kitchen, from soups and meat dishes to sweet treats and party nibbles. This theme was an obvious choice for me due to my insatiable love for food and my constant desire to explore diverse cuisines from around the globe. I am an avid cook myself and have been experimenting with various dishes from Turkish, Italian, Asian, African, and English cuisines. This venue is the perfect platform to bring together people in this profession who share this passion for cooking, allowing them to showcase their creativity and culinary skills in front of a live audience.

However, my primary objective for building this website is to enhance my skills in HTML and CSS. These two languages are crucial for achieving my ultimate goal, so I am exploring all the features I know to create this project. While I have used JavaScript in some instances for specific functionalities, my focus has been on HTML and CSS.


## Target audience

The target audience for Chefs-Shop are those who desire a unique culinary experience in the comfort of their own home. This includes both small and large kitchens that may receive unexpected guests without a chef on hand.

In addition, Chefs-Shop is targeted at aspiring and freelancing chefs who would like to join the team of chefs to provide top-quality services to clients worldwide. Some of the characteristics of Chefs-Shop chefs include but are not limited to:

 1. Experiment with color and texture.
 2. Plan ahead, prepare and organize.
 3. Choosing the perfect plate.
 4. Develop and plan menus and daily specials.
 5. Using the right tools for food plating.
 6. Getting the best ingredient that matches every recipe.
 7. Maintaining the standards for food storage, rotation, quality, and appearance.
 8. Ensuring compliance with applicable health codes and regulations.

By carefully considering the needs of our users, I crafted a website that boasts a visually striking design, sure to captivate and entice visitors. This is in a bid to give the impression that this culinary destination will leave a lasting impression and keep users coming back for more.

 ### Design

 Theme colors were selected from Mycolor Space palettes (see credits) and enhanced with Red-Green-Blue to stimulate creativity.


## Typography and color scheme

- ### Background
  I added a background color and background image to the webpage to create a 3D effect and to make it appear as though the background is touchable around the heading area. As users will be searching for content such as pictures to showcase culinary events at first glance, I opted for a background that is visually appealing and gives the right impression.

  For consistency, the sticky headings and fixed footer use the same background color as the rest of the page, with a transparent top color for subtle content viewing

## Features

  ### Composition of the Website
  The website is organized into three distinct web pages, accessible through a link in the header navbar. Users can easily navigate between pages such as the Home page, Gallery page, and Contact Us page. The website's structure provides a smooth and efficient user experience.

  - ### Landing page
    The landing page consists of a logo in the sticky header, followed by a cover with a background image, 4 sections and a footer.
    The purpose of this page is to introduce Chefs-Shop (section "Introductory"), to provide an appealing view of a chef preparing meals (section "about Chefs-Shop"), (section “Why Hire Us”) has a fixed background video showing food being prepared is to provide the quality of service users can get and a catchy event taken place, (section “What we offer:”) has another background image with different kinds of food and text to communicate Chefs-Shop services, within the text, there’s a border-radius photo dump section showing a Chef with his cutleries, and lastly the (section footer) displays social media links where users can further catch a glimpse of Chefs-Shop activity on the different platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.
