Chefs-Shop is a website that I built as part of my training to become a Full Stack Web Developer with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). This project allowed me to showcase my skills in both HTML and CSS.

To do this and simplify culinary needs, I created a one-stop online shop for expert chefs where users are connected with expert chefs who are ready to meet all of their culinary needs.

## About the project

I created this responsive Chefs-Shop website to practice, develop, and demonstrate my HTML and CSS skills. Chefs-Shop is an invented online shop that offers users access to various internationally experienced ready-to-go chefs. I have chosen this theme as I feel the need for such a place to exist where one can click and access a chef who can prepare different kinds of meals, whether for a small or large kitchen, from soups and meat dishes to sweet treats and party nibbles. This theme was an obvious choice for me due to my insatiable love for food and my constant desire to explore diverse cuisines from around the globe. I am an avid cook myself and have been experimenting with various dishes from Turkish, Italian, Asian, African, and English cuisines. This venue is the perfect platform to bring together people in this profession who share this passion for cooking, allowing them to showcase their creativity and culinary skills in front of a live audience.

However, my primary objective for building this website is to enhance my skills in HTML and CSS. These two languages are crucial for achieving my ultimate goal, so I am exploring all the features I know to create this project. While I have used JavaScript in some instances for specific functionalities, my focus has been on HTML and CSS.


## Target audience

The target audience for Chefs-Shop are those who desire a unique culinary experience in the comfort of their own home. This includes both small and large kitchens that may receive unexpected guests without a chef on hand.

In addition, Chefs-Shop is targeted at aspiring and freelancing chefs who would like to join the team of chefs to provide top-quality services to clients worldwide. Some of the characteristics of Chefs-Shop chefs include but are not limited to:

 1. Experiment with color and texture.
 2. Plan ahead, prepare and organize.
 3. Choosing the perfect plate.
 4. Develop and plan menus and daily specials.
 5. Using the right tools for food plating.
 6. Getting the best ingredient that matches every recipe.
 7. Maintaining the standards for food storage, rotation, quality, and appearance.
 8. Ensuring compliance with applicable health codes and regulations.

By carefully considering the needs of our users, I crafted a website that boasts a visually striking design, sure to captivate and entice visitors. This is in a bid to give the impression that this culinary destination will leave a lasting impression and keep users coming back for more.

 ### Design

## Typography and color scheme

- ### Background
  I added a background color and background image to the webpage to create a 3D effect and to make it appear as though the background is touchable around the heading area. As users will be searching for content such as pictures to showcase culinary events at first glance, I opted for a background that is visually appealing and gives the right impression.

  For consistency, the sticky headings and fixed footer use the same background color as the rest of the page, with a transparent top color for subtle content viewing

## Features

  ### Composition of the Website
  The website is organized into three distinct web pages, accessible through a link in the header navbar. Users can easily navigate between pages such as the Home page, Gallery page, and Contact Us page. The website's structure provides a smooth and efficient user experience.

  - ### Landing page
    The landing page consists of a logo in the sticky header, followed by a cover with a background image, 4 sections and a footer.
    The purpose of this page is to introduce Chefs-Shop (section "Introductory"), to provide an appealing view of a chef preparing meals (section "about Chefs-Shop"), (section “Why Hire Us”) has a fixed background image showing food being prepared is to provide the quality of service users can get and a catchy event taken place, (section “What we offer:”) has an image with a chef portioning food and text to communicate Chefs-Shop services. a section that communicates the services users can get with an image, a section about a catchy meal prepared by chefs with text, a section that showcases an image of a chef cooking with text, a section that gives users the guarantee of quality services and customer-ready response, and lastly the (footer section) displays social media links where users can further catch a glimpse of Chefs-Shop activity on the different platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.

  - ### Navbar
    The purpose of the navigation bar and footer is to assist users in navigating the website smoothly and efficiently. The footer also provides links to relevant social media sites, which open in new tabs to ensure a seamless browsing experience.

     - The nav bar is located at the top of the page.
     - Within the nav bar there is the logo of Chef-Shop which navigates to the landing page on a click.
     - The nav bar also contains three links on the right hand side:
        * <strong>HOME:</strong> After clicking on it, the user will be redirected to the Home page. From there, they will be able to browse through several sections including 'About Us', 'Why Hire Us', and the services and policies offered by Chefs-Shop. The page also consists of a footer that contains links to the company's social media pages.
        * <strong>GALLERY:</strong> The gallery is where you can find an assortment of pictures showcasing different chefs in action in the kitchen, using a variety of cooking equipment and preparing a wide range of delicious meals.
        * <strong>CONTACT US:</strong> This leads the user to the Contact Us page, where they can book a chef service, request additional services, or receive a callback for further information.

    - The Home page, Gallery page and the Contact Us page links have an animated mouse hover effect.
  
    - The navigation is well-organized and easy to understand, making it simple for the user to navigate through the website:

    - The website's navigation bar is designed to be responsive on smaller screens, such as mobile devices. On these smaller screens, a burger icon menu is displayed on the right side of the navbar. When the user clicks on this icon, a dropdown menu appears with links to the Home, Gallery, and Contact Us pages. This ensures that users can easily navigate the website, regardless of the device they are using.

  - ### Gallery page
    The Gallery page comprises a header, different images in the body, and a footer. The primary aim of this page is to showcase the creativity of Chefs-Shop and its versatility with different types of food to attract and entice users with mouthwatering food images and Chefs on display.

  - ### Contact Us page
    The Contact Us page comprises a header, along with sections for Name, Last name, Email, and Comment to provide more details on the requested services, followed by a footer. The primary objective of this page is to enable users to send a message to request services and also to locate the physical address of the site on Google Maps.

    </details>

  - ### Responsive devices
    The website has been designed to be responsive and easily accessible on any device. For instance, when viewed on a phone screen, the navigation bar is replaced by a burger icon button, making it easier to navigate. Additionally, the text in some sections has been modified to fit the screen size, ensuring that users get complete information regardless of the device they are using. This approach allows laptop and desktop users to access detailed information while phone users can focus on the main information.

  - ### Animations
    To enhance the user experience, the website has minimal animation. However, to make navigation easier, the links in the navigation bar change their background color and padding when the mouse hovers over them while the text goes underlined simultaneously.

  - ### Positioning
    I have made sure to carefully position the elements on every page, including the Home page, Gallery page, and Contact Us page, to ensure the best possible user experience and accessibility.
