Chefs-Shop is a website that I built as part of my training to become a Full Stack Web Developer with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). This project allowed me to showcase my skills in both HTML and CSS.

To do this and simplify culinary needs, I created a one-stop online shop for expert chefs where users are connected with expert chefs who are ready to meet all of their culinary needs.
